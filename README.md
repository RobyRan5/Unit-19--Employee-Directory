# Unit-19--Employee-Directory-Homework    

As a HR director for a company, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information and have it centrally located. 

It is more efficient when I'm able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
  
  This application focuses on front end web developing. I will be using randomusers.me to help me create a user pool. I then to make a request to that API.

Once I the data is returned, I need to filter using async request. The filter properties should allow me to filter by DOB and by Name. 

I will be using boostrap for my styling and then deploying the application to Heroku.
